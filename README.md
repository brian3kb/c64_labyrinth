# Commodore 64 Labyrinth
My take on the classic Commodore 64 one-liner (10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10) to create a random labyrinth pattern on the screen. 
Inspiration from the 10 PRINT book available under CC -> http://10print.org/

Just have a mess with the controls and hit the start button, there are a few presets to choose from giving different styles

For the classic C64 look, the font from http://style64.org/c64-truetype/license has been used, license for its use is included in the fonts directory.
